Things this project can be extended by:
  StudyGuide:
    WYSIWYG editor- Didn't know about it when making the thing. There will be problems with db compatibility but I don't care. No need for versioning either(tho it would be cool)
  Test:
    Add option type where you have to sort a list of answers by dragging. -- PracujemSPrilbou was working on it idk
    Change question creator so that multiple option types can be under one question(db supports it just not FE)
    Change question creator so that multiple images can exist under 1 question
    Fix how it looks.
    Fix how ugly the Evaluation is (X points/Max points)
  Other:
    MCP->working on it now
