        <span>I'm reworking this site into a platform! In this way anyone may share their study guides online and keep them within their custom school environment</span>
        <br><br>
        <span>This is an open source student project and passwords are not safe in my hands!</span>
        <br><br>
        <span>There are 2 account tiers 1)user 2)supervisor. Supervisors role is to take care of content in school environments. They may create update delete everything and anything which belongs to school supervised by them. Users may only suggest changes to content on a study guide but it's up to supervisor to accept or deny this change. Users account may be changed to supervisor of certain school upon request(to me) or by another supervisor.</span>
